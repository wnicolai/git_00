## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->

At night she sighed "I fear 'twas wrong

I'll sing to thee to-morrow."  
  
## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->
Some say the world will end in fire,  
Some say in ice.

## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->
 The sun was shining on the sea,  
Shining with all his might:

And this was odd, because it was   
The middle of the night.  
  
The moon was shining sulkily,  
Because she thought the sun   
Had got no business to be there   
After the day was done--  
"It's very rude of him," she said,  
"To come and spoil the fun!"
